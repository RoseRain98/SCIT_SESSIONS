Question-1:

They asked to generate the probabilites of random poison distribution,and plot the histogram for these points for 3 times:

To generate the probailites of random poison distribution I used numpy.random.poison(lam,1000) which will return an array of the probabilites of the 1000 samples.

Then based on the array, by using matplotlib.pyplot ,I plotted these points on a graph.

Question-2:

They asked generate the probabilites of random normal distribution,and plot the histogram for these points for 3 times:

To generate the probailites of random normal distribution I used numpy.random.normal(mu,sigma,1000) ,which will return an array of the probabilites of the 1000 samples.

Then based on array,using matplotlib.pyplot, I plotted these points on a graph.

Question-3:(Slight doubt in doing it)

They asked to generate the graphs for selecting the 100 random samples from Q-1 ,Q-2 and mean them and plot the graph for 100 times.
